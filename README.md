# FlacFinder  
**Do I have that artist in FLAC?**  

## Features  
- ✅ Search for an artist in your music folders to check if you have it all in FLAC, or display which albums/files are not FLAC
- ✅ Find and log duplicate audio files (will log duplicate songs across multiple file types)

## Configuration

FlacFinder gets its music locations to search from the music.txt file. 

Ensure all paths to your music folders are listed there, one per line.
